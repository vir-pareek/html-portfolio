Hello visitors, glad to see you are curious to know more about me.

<p>My name is Vir Pareek. With God's grace I passed out from my school <a href="https://dbms.edu.in/index.php">DBMS English School</a> with flying colours. 
  I was also able to secure JEE mains rank AIR 11290 and JEE Advanced rank 10399 which was more than sufficient to land me in one of the best colleges
   <a href="https://www.bitmesra.ac.in/">Birla Institute Of Technology, Mesra</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Here I am learning to code, to develop amazing websites and putting everything I have in making this world a better place for everyone,
   by providing solution to the problems of the Biosphere.
